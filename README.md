Final project

# What the project does

This project is my final project for Mobile Friendly Websites.

*install bootstrap and VS code*

## Why the project is useful

This project shows what I've learned in this class. It shows the progression of the same website I made in Websites for Beginners.

## Documentation

HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Java Script *very minor*
## How users can get started with the project

This project uses bootstrap. 

## Where users can get help with your project

I wanted my website to be even more responsive. I think I would of had more success if I made my website fully responsive first. Unfortuately, I made it responsive after I designed the site.
